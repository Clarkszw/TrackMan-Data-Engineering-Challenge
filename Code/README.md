# Code-Challenge

For this task, I will determine the relationships between database tables as described across a series of configuration files in JSON.

Here are the steps I take:

1. Read and understand the Challenge.
2. Check table file to get familar with JSON format.
3. Make first code snippet to try one file.
4. Make a unit test for the code snippet.
5. Scale it to all tables in the directory.
6. Update the unit test for the final script.
7. update the documentation.
